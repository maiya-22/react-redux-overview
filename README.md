The Goal of this App:
 is to simplify react-redux onto one page of code (in the App.js file) 
 so that it's possible to see all of the different pieces in one place.

 In the app.js, data is fetched asynchronistically and used to update the App's state in the Provider/Store.

INSTRUCTIONS:

install:
npm install

start app:
npm start

Turn off "prettier" extension, so that code does not reformat on save. 
It's written to try to make things more clear/ uses few arrow functions, etc.

Make sure to be on Chrome browser, with Redux extension installed.
